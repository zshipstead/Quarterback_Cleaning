# Quarterback_Cleaning

The data come from Tableau Public datasets (https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources). 
The cleaning process reduced the players to only quarterbacks who started their careers between 1999 and 2009. 
These rules mean that any player from this data set may have records for 5 years (data set is 2009-2013), which is a little more than the average career.

Ultimately, I didn't use this set, but the cleaning process might be helpful to some people.
